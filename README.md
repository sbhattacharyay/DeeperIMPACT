# Deeper IMPACT: Ordinal Models for Outcome Prediction After Traumatic Brain Injury

## Overview

This repository contains the code underlying the article entitled **Deeper IMPACT: Ordinal Models for Outcome Prediction After Traumatic Brain Injury** from the [CENTER-TBI](https://www.center-tbi.eu/) database. In this file, we present the abstract, to outline the motivation for the work and the findings, and then a brief description of the code which we generate these finding and achieve this objective.\
\
The code on this repository is commented throughout to provide a description of each step alongside the code which achieves it.

## Abstract
### Background/Objective:
### Methods
### Results
### Conclusions

## Code 
All of the code used in this work can be found in the `scripts` directory as R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). We have also made the code available in `html` form with the following prefix `https://sbhattacharyay.github.io/DeeperIMPACT/html/` and the suffix `.html`. For instance, `scripts/15_manuscript_figures.Rmd` can also be accessed on a browswer at https://sbhattacharyay.github.io/DeeperIMPACT/html/15_manuscript_figures.html.
